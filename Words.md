some men explore nothing at all. other explore the great infinite. i prefer the vast infinitesimal. you can visit ports on every ocean and sea. and get a sense of the diversity of life. or you can recognize that between any two ports is a wealth of life. you can taste a bit of every woman in world. or you can explore every inch of one woman. then you multiply all this by time - all the time of your life. and what do you have? i would choose all the nuances of these sweetwater seas of these Great Lakes over the vastness of the vast ocean. I prefer the depth and beauty of that woman right there than having a taste of women around the world.

“Techno taught me how to organize abstraction in my mind; the repetition opens up corridors of your conscious thought,” Johnson explains. “Working with stone in Africa, you see how rhythm manifests itself physically. If your beat is erratic, the stone responds erratically which makes it harder to carve. If you’re doing it more rhythmically, it opens up and allows you to work in harmony with whatever your medium is."

You’ve said before that your own most innovative music shall remain unreleased, is this still the case and if so why?
Sometimes I love making music that I can’t hear anywhere else. I love filling the gaps that other people leave, even if it’s really subtle. That’s what buzzes me up. I like having time to develop the gaps. If I were to release some of that kind of stuff people would copy it, I would hear it and it would put me off developing it further. This has happened to me a lot. I wish I hadn’t released certain tracks because I wanted to do more like them but was put off by the copies. I feel like it’s been taken away from me.

Brianna was born in Windsor, across the strait from Detroit. Generations ago dad’s side of the family rode the underground railroad from Moultrie, Georgia. They followed the drinking gourd to Detroit. Detroit was midnight. The last stop before dawn, Windsor. As she looked across the river at the Detroit skyline and desired to go, to rave, to dance, to explore she would hear the voice of her grandfather: don’t go to Detroit. the world doesn’t roll from dawn to midnight and you shouldn’t either. Stay here. It’s safe. Too many guns over there. Too dangerous. And she believed it. She watched the American news at night. Horrified. But also picked up a phrase or two that you didn’t hear on mainstream American television. What up doe? I see you.

Emerson May Day on Lake Superior wind harp:
 So by remote Superior Lake,
And by resounding Mackinac,
When northern storms and forests shake,
And billows on the long beach break,
The artful Air doth separate
Note by note all sounds that grate,
Smothering in her ample breast
All but godlike words,
Reporting to the happy ear
Only purified accords.
Strangely wrought from barking waves,
Soft music daunts the Indian braves,—
Convent-chanting which the child
Hears pealing from the panther’s cave
And the impenetrable wild.

Mackinaw City – — First, a small number of beads peeked from the sandy loam.

It would take archaeologists at Fort Michilimackinac just two days to uncover their centuries-old secrets.

On June 23, James Dunnigan worked the spot where the beads were spotted. It was a good day to move dirt. Winds gusted, too blustery to use outdoor sifters to look for artifacts. They had seen this before, fractured remnants of another time, disembodied pottery, nails, food bones.

As Dunnigan worked his trowel that mid-60s afternoon, a knotted clump emerged.

“I was stunned. Everything seemed silent. Some person valued it, cared about it a great deal,” said Dunnigan, a second-year archeology graduate student from Western Michigan University.

Covered in dirt was an intact rosary, more than 250 years old, a signature of frontier faith for a French fur trader and his household.

“It’s a wildest dream kind of thing,” said Lynn Evans, curator of archaeology for Mackinac State Historic Parks. “I would dare say it will be among the top find of his career, perhaps top five.”

The timing was perfect: It is the 300th anniversary of the founding of Fort Michilimackinac, at the top of the Lower Peninsula, a walkable distance from the ferries that run tourists to Mackinac Island. The unexpected find punctuates a summer-long observance of the tricentennial. An announcement about public viewing is expected soon, so visitors can see it this tourism season.

The rosary is bone gray and white, with beads that are less than pea-sized.

“You are looking at something that no human has touched or seen for centuries,” said Kelsey Schnell, park spokesman.

Here, along lakes Huron and Michigan, Charles Gonneville presumably prayed. He was a French-Canadian fur trader, protected at Michilimackinac, beginning in 1727. George Washington was not yet born.

The small Gonneville home in the five-unit southeast rowhouse was 25 feet by 26 feet, made of white pine or cedar. Walls were framed vertically, like posts in the ground, easier to install for skilled traders who perhaps were lesser carpenters.

This Crown of Roses has ivory beads with brass links. The religious icon, like those today, would pass though fingertips, each bead used to contemplate events in the lives of Jesus and Mary.

Perhaps at some point, the rosary slipped through cracks in the floor boards, or was hidden. It joined nails, glass, and broken ceramic, lost for centuries.

The rosary is unusual for its number of beads: 72. A more typical Dominican rosary has 60. The Michilimackinac find is believed to be of the Roman Catholic Bridgettines Order.

A loop with five “decades” includes a large bead and 10 smaller ones for each decade. An unusual sixth stretch has nine beads, either missing one or made without it. As is typical, the rosary has a short strand culminating in a cross, which also may be missing a bead.

Though the period in which Gonneville prayed and traded seems long ago, the years since then are just one-thousandth of the history of modern humans. In that sense, the rosary is a remnant of our times.

As today, the wind could be raw-boned. Some traders went back to Montreal for the winter.

Charles Henri Desjardins de Rupallay de Gonneville traded at Michilimackinac from 1727 to 1754, according to trading licenses and historical maps.

Gonneville was married to Marie Charlotte Leriger. A map indicate her sister, Marie Catherine, lived next door with her husband, Rene Bourassa, Gonneville’s sometime business partner.

The rosary is dated to 1749, the time that a map links Gonneville to this specific house. The fort, built by the French about 12 years before his arrival, was occupied by the British in 1761 after the French and Indian War. To remain, French traders had to switch allegiance from Louis to George, not hard for many frontiersmen who may have had less attachment to the throne.

Some had married Odawa and Ojibwa Indians. Lakes Michigan and Huron were a watery superhighway. The area became an important trade center for furs from around the Great Lakes. The pelts of 50-70-pound beavers were among the most valuable furs passing through Michilimackinac’s gates.

With a winter trapping season’s worth of pelts, Native Americans could purchase muskets, blankets, knives, kettles, beads, gunpowder, and a wealth of other European goods.

After this summer, the rosary will be removed, more painstakingly cleaned and studied.

“To find an intact anything was just a shock,” said Steve Brisson, deputy director for Mackinac State Historic Park.

Despite their knowledge of the rosary, many more questions remain for researchers.

“I would like to know why it was left behind,” Evans said.

These are just words. Words lead the thoughts. Thoughts lead the words. They trade off like a sailboat tacking windward to leeward and back. There is a rhythm to words. The rhythm can dictate the words and therefore the thoughts. The rhythm of the words traps us in our culture, enforces bad grammar and traps us in poor word choice. Yet the trappings of culture liberate us from the drudgery of globalism like the girl blowing dandelions along the building across the field on Bagley Street. Wow.

 WG: I always feel like one of the guys inside those incredible dragons you see snaking through the crowds in Chinatown. Sure, the dragon is very brightly colored, but from the inside you know the whole thing is pretty flimsy- just a bunch of old newspapers and papier-mache and balsa struts.

LM: One of the issues your work raises is the way information- this "dance of data," as you refer to it- not only controls our daily lives but may be the best way for us to understand the fundamental processes that control the universe's ongoing transformation. It seems significant that mostly SF writers are tuned to this.
WG: Information is the dominant scientific metaphor of our age, so we need to face it, to try to understand what it means. It's not that technology has changed everything by transforming it into codes. Newtonians didn't see things in terms of information exchange, but today we do. That carries over into my suspicion that Sigmund Freud has a lot to do with steam engines- both seem to be similar metaphors.

After college, I thought of myself as a businessman. An ambitious American businessman working at a big software company, checking the company stock price at night, selling stock options on the regular, paying down the mortgage. Kissing my wife.

10 years later at Ocean Beach I’m about to turn 30, absentmindedly rubbing a glass nub on the bottom of a beer bottle thinking of a dozen deadlines at work, scores of people with daddy issues, mommy issues, smelling the pungent seaweed odor in the air and there I realized: I’m not a businessman, I’m an entrepreneur.

Fast forward five years. While enduring the hardships of startup life, waking up in a sweat every other morning afraid that all the money’s going to dry up, having M.C. Escher nightmares of the configuration of the economy questioning just what exactly is holding it all up and who’s paying my paycheck, my employees’ paychecks, how does this work? how are they getting paid? I asked myself what I enjoyed. It wasn’t this. It wasn’t running a startup. So I demoted myself to inventor.

Then the joy started: idea after idea for inventions and the possible impacts on society and fame and fortune, drawings everywhere and code, lotsa code and then the realization hit: I wasn’t actually building anything. It was work. A lot of work. But Henry Ford was lazy. It was a struggle. But there was no follow through. And I needed days, weeks at a time to just dissappear into myself. Every minor disturbance was an attack, a thrust at my fragile concentration and dreaming. So there would be no James Couzens for me. I was too lazy even for an intermediary with business acumen. For me it was about the joy of ideas, the flowing and colliding of thoughts like ice floes on a strait. And that’s that point at which - just after turning 40 - that I gave myself my final demotion and admitted defeat: I’m a writer. 

A goddamn middle-aged writer who - with the exception of some corporate blog posts and an ebook ghost written by a capable Irishwoman - has never published a thing in his life.

and then realize a crazy point: after all that money is spent, not a single citizen can get from point A to point B. why? each of us still needs to buy a car, car maintenance, car insurance, car registration, speeding tickets, parking tickets, a driver's license and - hello war and terrorism - gas. they end up hating the snow, hating the rain, hating traffic, hating the drivers around them, stressing out, gaining belly fat, driving drunk and generally sitting around unproductive on their way to and from work. and you think public transit is socialism? maybe it’s the Irish Whiskey talking, but I don’t think you’ve thought it through, my man.

What does Detroit have in common with Italy? If you look at Michigan county-by-county, it’s number one ethnic group is German. It’s English speaking but teutonic acting. The African influence pulls the psychographics of Detroit south toward sub-saharan Africa but not too far, these folks are still working in factories making and living in the center of industrial world...so Italy is about far enough.

This painting by van eyck of people praying. It looks squished. But as u stare at it it seems like maybe their prayer is working. That space time is gathering around them. About to open a hole for an angel to flutter through. The explanation is that these artists didn't have linear perspective. But what if that's wrong? What if they had it not set it aside - to make such a secular painting would be a waste, not art - in order to capture the feeling of meditation, reaching beyond. The linear view of things is a filter on top of what we really perceive and what is really out there. I hope that death is that: a final removal of the linear filter. And maybe there violence will have some rational, humorous meaning. All the victims laughing, smoking weed waiting for the rest of us to join a hand of euchre.

the less we know the more entropy. the more surprise the more entropy. if we heat up a room the stuff in it has more states that it can occupy. thereby increasing entropy and decreasing information. why does hot flow to cold? it can increase possible states. more freedom. entropy increases.
===
suburban sprawl seems like a natural consequence of increasing entropy at first glance. but in the way that we’ve designed suburbs it’s actually wrong. it is a misunderstanding of the possible degrees of freedom. assume car constrained then draw the graph of all possible states for getting food in your system or interacting with other people and you will quickly see that the urban configuration with vertical design allows for a graph with more degrees of freedom. drunk? driving? is illegal everywhere. closing of whole parts of the graph when driving is the only option.

1979: A 25-year-old Ford Motor assembly line worker is killed on the job in a Flat Rock, Michigan, casting plant.1 It’s the first recorded human death by robot. Robert Williams’ death came on the 58th anniversary of the premiere of Karel Capek’s play about Rossum’s Universal Robots. R.U.R gave the world the first use of the word robot to describe an artificial person. Capek invented the term, basing it on the Czech word for “forced labor.” (Robot entered the English language in 1923.)

Black artists must go through Europe to achieve success? Maybe more generally Detroit artists must go through Europe. Peel of the BBC made the White Stripes what they are by doing it in the UK. The US media industries in LA and NY has a bias against Detroit. Places like Manchester and Sheffield have a bias for Detroit. Neither is accurate, but if one is ready for something good to come from a place the good stuff is more likely to get recognition. NY and LA will never break a Detroit act that is anything more than a derivative of the stuff they already have. Detroit should just open branch offices in the west of England.

There is this question of national permission. Detroiters don’t need to get permission from NY or LA to create, to innovate. We are the connection between the physics, the reality of the world and the abstractions and symbol manipulators of the coast. if it collapses it will be Detroit that holds it up.

This notion of copying techno is like the hofstatder experiment of mutating music it gets empty after a while. entropy removes the structure and patterns. there is no external energy source. that’s what the electrofying mojo provided.

===
My advice to you, young Techno wannabe, is to not like Techno. don’t be influenced by Techno. What you’re missing - and it’s not your fault - is you don’t have a E. Mojo. You don’t have someone providing you the raw ingredients. But you do have the web of life, the web of music. So, listen to everything. Then use these tools. Then you will create the next wave of techno. If you’re just true to Techno you create noise. Be true to music.

The Motown sound was of the moment. But Techno will be perennially in the future. Like a ___ that is adjusted 5 years, 10 years ahead. You listen to any techno the original tracks, the second wave, shit that’s made and heard in the future will still sound like a music of the future. In many ways it’s a failure. Like the tubular architecture of Cobo and the Ren Cen visitors look at it askew and call it futuristic. It’s from the 70s. It missed the mark then and it still misses today. It’s trying to stack the deck against Maxwell’s demon. Anticipating further out where the taste and aesthetic will be. It’s almost like a shoulder shrug. We weren’t quite able to synthesize what is happening and needed today. so our co opt will be to guess the future. like a hail mary pass to end the football game.  but that’s populist. so many of us do it every day. things we care about. things we don’t. we shrug heave and hope for the best. then leave town for somewhere warmer, or more bustling or just more accepted, somewhere with more movies to it’s credit. more sitcoms. this is not Jennifer Aniston’s kinda place.
===
Playing music to a crowd is the best way to create great music. It’s like sales and marketing. Great marketing is really just great sales at scale. You get the newly minted Ivy League MBAs and they start marketing from the abstract. It fails. You need to get in there and sell face to face. Learn what moves people. Then go back to the cube and scale it into a marketing campaign.

We elevate NY and LA as our centers of media and everything else is viewed as a backwater. But that’s like thinking about genetics from the organisms perspective. It’s upside down and inside out. With Jazz, Rock and Roll, Motown, Punk, Techno we craft the new musical ideas, memes here as a response to the rubbish they’re pumping at us from the coasts. Then once it’s good enough we export it first to the UK, not London, but Manchester and Sheffield. Then to the continent Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin where it gains mass. Then we find it gets imported back into NY and LA. This is how it worked for Berry Gordy, Iggy Pop, MC5, Juan Atkins, Jack White...and it continues. They can claim to be the cultural centers but really they are recycling the ideas, upcycling them to higher shelves - where the money is. But they are not generative. Not truly deeply generative. From the perspective of the meme, NY and LA are just carriers that allow the ideas to reproduce, mutate and win or lose in the marketplace of sounds. So why don’t others flock here? Violence. There is no art without violence. But there is no popular artist movement without peace and safety. True innovators live in that chaotic boundary between peace and murder.
