The field excites me. But we r going to chase down this quantum computer dream only to find that it's nature itself. It's this river. The hydrogen pairs quantum entangling their way to just flow around this island. 
If we switch to Bitcoin. And later create a quantum computer more socio economic destruction will follow than mankind has ever known. It will make the fears of the LHC seem preferable.
